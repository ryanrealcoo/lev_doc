### Windows

#### 1. Docker Installation

Pre-knowledge：[What is Docker](https://www.redhat.com/zh/topics/containers/what-is-docker)

Reference：[Install Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

If you have already installed Docker on the device, please check its version number. The Docker version should be **≥ 20.10.10**. If so, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you need to upgrade your Docker.

There are majorly two types of system configurations for installing Docker on Windows:

- WSL 2 backend

- Hyper-V backend and Windows containers

##### 1.1 Enable CPU to support virtualization

Enter the system BIOS setting, and check whether the BIOS has enabled CPU virtualization support, as shown in the following figure:

![开启虚拟化支持.jpg](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/2e12d9cd-cf65-4c6c-88a2-1b6d42110f22.JPEG)

##### 1.2 Win10 Home Edition - Preliminary Steps

We strongly recommend you upgrade to Win10 Professional or use Linux & Mac. **If you are using Win10 Professional Edition / Enterprise Edition / Education Edition, please skip this step and enter 1.3.**

First, you need to enable the hyper-v module. Windows Home Edition cannot query the hyper-v function module. It needs to be enabled in a particular way, as follows:

Update the operating system to the latest version.
Windows Setting -> Updates -> Check for Updates

Enable "show file extensions"
Reference: [show file extension](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/f7ff0bfcc9c0e12e26bb13a0.html)		

Copy the following code into the new document:			

```vbscript
pushd "%~dp0"
dir /b %SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\*Hyper-V*.mum >hyper-v.txt
for /f %%i in ('findstr /i . hyper-v.txt 2^>nul') do dism /online /norestart /add-package:"%SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\%%i"
del hyper-v.txt
Dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V-All /LimitAccess /ALL
```

Save the document as install-hyper-v.cmd, right click "run as administrator":

![安装hyper-v.png](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/61620bb6-2a0d-4974-a27c-39471f7c0020.png)		

Enter Y after installation, and Restart (Note: **If you update the system after the installation, it may lead to the invalid hyper-v installation. Remember to double-check and re-install hyper-v if needed.**)			

Repeat the steps above, save the following code as change.cmd, and run as administrator:

```cmd
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion" /v EditionId /T REG_EXPAND_SZ /d Professional /F
```

At this point, Windows 10 Home Edition hyper-v is enabled.

##### 1.3 Win10 Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition, Education Edition

Please choose one of the following two methods:

- WSL 2 backend

> Install WSL 2. Reference:  [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/wsl/install)
>
> Enable virtualization. Reference:  [Enable virtualization](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization)
> Specific setting path: `Control Panel` -> `Programs` -> `Enable or Disable Windows Features` -> Check `Windows Subsystem for Linux` and `Virtual Machine Platform`, and then follow the prompts to restart.

- Hyper-V backend and Windows containers

> `Control Panel` -> `Programs` -> `Enable or Disable Windows Features` -> Check `Hyper-V`, then follow the prompts to restart.

The following steps are generic and must be performed on all Windows systems: ​			

- Check if Virtualization is enabled. Reference:  [Virtualization check](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization-must-be-enabled)

- Download [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/), and install the executable file.

- After restart, Docker Desktop will run automatically

If the docker engine logo in the lower-left corner of the graphical interface is green, that means Docker is successfully installed and initiated.

#### 2 Token uploads and acquisition

##### 2.1 Check ssh
​
Run `powershell` as an administrator and enter `ssh` to check if the ssh command is installed on the system:

![image.png](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/3e4dd10e-3021-4647-a9e4-09877140b6f6.png)

If the content shown above does not appear, you can install ssh command as in  [Install OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) .

##### 2.2 Generate ssh public key locally
Enter the command `cd ~` to enter the current user directory, and then enter the `ls .ssh` command to check whether the ssh key exists, namely the two files `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`:

![查看ssh密钥.png](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/2997d374-f873-439b-ba77-d567adae155e.png)

As shown in the figure above, it shows that no path exists, meaning that the file does not exist. Therefore, you need to create the file manually. Enter the following command and execute it in a new line:

```
ssh-keygen.exe -t ed25519
```

It will prompt for input, but you should just ignore it and keep pressing the Enter key all the way to the end, until the following prompt appears. That means this step is complete:

> It is not recommended to use the default rsa encryption method to generate keys. rsa keys are actually disabled by default in higher versions of openssh.

```vbscript
+---[ed25519 256]----+
|        .o       |
|        o        |
|      oo .       |
|.     ++o  .     |
|o.  ...*S.o      |
|.o+.o.o+=. .     |
|.o.+. o=.o+o     |
|. .. *oo.oB.o    |
| ...oE*.o=o+     |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Now, enter `ls ~/.ssh` again, and the two files mentioned above will be displayed:

![密钥.jpg](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/38c66c66-6a58-4609-800a-032a13f0c3c8.JPEG)

Enter the `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` command, and copy the output public key information. Login to the LEV platform, click `Account Settings` - `Public Key Management`, `Create SSH public key`. Submit the public key file content that you just copied.

#### 2.3 Configure ssh config file

create a `new text document.txt` in the `C drive\user\(current user name)\.ssh\` directory, open the file, add the following content and save the file:

```yaml
Host lev
    HostName service.lev.zone
    Port 2222
    User username # Replace username with your username on LEV
```

After saving, rename the file as `config`.

> Note: there is no "txt" suffix here. The file type should be a file instead of a text document.

Enter the `ssh lev` command to verify if the configuration is successful:

```Bash
$ ssh lev
Connection to service.lev.zone closed. # When this message is displayed, the configuration is successful
```

If the following message is returned, there is a problem with the configuration file. Please check the previous configuration steps:

```Bash
$ ssh lev
Permission denied (publickey). # If this message is displayed, the ssh public key configuration is incorrect and please check whether the ssh public key and user name are correct
```

If the above process shows an error, you can also enter the following command line directly:

```bash
ssh username@service.lev.zone -p 2222
# (Replace the username with your LEV username instead of any email!)
```

#### 2.4 Start

On the `Account Avatar` - `Account Settings` - `My Device` page, select `Add Device`, enter a name at will, and click Submit.

**After that, click the "copy" button of the device, execute the command on the clipboard in the terminal, and enable the local environment.**

This command will automatically pull the image and start the container, and the whole process may take a few minutes.

After the command is executed, on the `Account Avatar` - `Account Settings` - `My Device` page, you can see that the device is online.

> If the speed of pulling containers is too slow due to network reasons, it can be accelerated by replacing the docker image source.

> Open Docker, click Settings, click Docker Engine, and you will see the following page

> Copy the code:
> ```Bash

>
> Click Apply&Restart and you're done!
>
> After completing the acceleration operations as above, you should execute the following command again to start the local environment:
>
> ```bash
> ssh lev agent | docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker --rm -i talentsec/lev
> ```

After the command is executed, you can check the `Account Avatar` - `Account Settings` - `My Device` page, and the device should be online.
