## Windows

> Remark: The underlying technical solution implemented by Docker Desktop under Windows is based on virtual machine technology, and the nat network mode is used by default. Because of this, there might be unexpected behaviors in some scenarios when using tools such as Nmap for LAN scanning.

### 1. Install Docker
Pre-knowledge: [what is docker](https://www.redhat.com/zh/topics/containers/what-is-docker)

Reference：[Install Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

If Docker is installed on your device, please check its version number. Leviathan supports **20.10.10** and above. If this condition is met, you can skip this step, otherwise, please install or update Docker

The system configuration for installing Docker on Windows mainly consists of the following two types:

- WSL 2 backend

- Hyper-V backend and Windows containers

#### 1.1 Enable CPU virtualization support

Enter the BIOS settings in system and check whether the BIOS has enabled CPU virtualization support as below.		

![Enable virtualization support.jpg](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/2e12d9cd-cf65-4c6c-88a2-1b6d42110f22.JPEG)

#### 1.2 Win10 Home Edition Pre-step

It is strongly recommended to upgrade to Win10 Professional version or use Linux, Mac. **If you use Win10 Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition or Education Edition, please skip this step and enter 1.3.**

First, you need to enable the Hyper-V module. The Windows Home Edition cannot query the 'Hyper-V' function module. It needs to be enabled in a special way as follows:

Update the operating system to the latest version, Windows Settings -> Update -> Check for updates

Enable the display of file extensions. For details [refer to File Extension Display](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/f7ff0bfcc9c0e12e26bb13a0.html)		

Copy the following code into a new document:		

```vbscript
pushd "%~dp0"
dir /b %SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\*Hyper-V*.mum >hyper-v.txt
for /f %%i in ('findstr /i . hyper-v.txt 2^>nul') do dism /online /norestart /add-package:"%SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\%%i"
del hyper-v.txt
Dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V-All /LimitAccess /ALL
```

Save the document as install-hyper-v.cmd, right click and run as administrator.

![install hyper-v.png](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/l/3.1-2.png)		

After the installation is completed, enter Y and restart. (Note: **If the system is updated after the installation is completed, it may cause the installation to be invalid, you need to check, and if necessary, reinstall hyper-v**)			

Repeat the above steps, save the following code as change.cmd and run as administrator.

```cmd
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion" /v EditionId /T REG_EXPAND_SZ /d Professional /F
```

Now, the Win10 Home Edition Hyper-V should be enabled.

#### 1.3 Win10 Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition, Education Edition

Please choose one of the following two methods based on the solution you use:

- WSL 2 backend

> To install WSL 2, please refer to the link [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
>
> To enable virtualization, please refer to the link to [enable virtualization](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization)，and the setting method is `Control Panel` -> `Programs` -> `Enable or Disable Windows Functions` -> Check `Windows Subsystem for Linux` and `Virtual Machine Platform`, and then follow the prompts to restart.

- Hyper-V backend and Windows containers

> `Control Panel` -> `Programs` -> `Enable or Disable Windows Functions` -> Check `Hyper-V`, then follow the prompts to restart.

The following steps are common and must be performed on all Windows systems:​			

- Check whether virtualization is enabled. For details, please refer to [Virtualization Check](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization-must-be-enabled)

- Download [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/), install the executable file

- After the restart, Docker Desktop will run automatically

When the Docker Logo on the lower left corner is green, it means you have successfully launched Docker!

### 2. Install Python3.10

Please go to the [python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the python installation package (version ≥ 3.10 is required), click it and install.

### 3. Install PDM 

PDM is a modern Python package manager that supports [PEP 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/). It is similar to npm, installing and managing packages in a way that doesn't require creating a virtualenv. 

Leviathan use PDM for testing, publishing and dependency management.

> [Whata is PDM？](https://pdm.fming.dev/)

**Recommended installation method**

Use the script provided by the official website to specify the version to install:

```bash
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdm-project/pdm/main/install-pdm.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```

> Execute in cmd or powershell

### 4. Install pdm-lev plugin

pdm-lev is a pdm plugin provided by Leviathan, which is used for project construction, development, testing and management, and can automatically generate the Leviathan project framework.

Install using the following command:

```bash
pdm plugin add pdm-lev
```

After the execution is completed, the terminal returns

```bash
✔ Installation succeeds.
```

It means the installation is successful.

> The latest version of pdm-lev is 1.2.6, and the installed version can be judged by the following command:
>
> ```bash
> pdm plugin list
> ```
>
> If it is found that the version of pdm-lev is too low, it is most likely caused by the source not being synchronized in time. Just switch the source of python and reinstall it.

> pdm-lev does not provide an automatic upgrade method for the time being. You can use the following commands to upgrade manually:
>
> ```bash
> $ pdm plugin remove pdm-lev
> $ pdm plugin add pdm-lev
> ```

### 5. IDE configuration

In order for the IDE to work, we first have to enable the pep582 proposal globally.

> Q：What is pep582 proposal?（refer to the link [pep582](https://peps.python.org/pep-0582/)）
>
> A：The pep582 configuration allows the python interpreter to automatically look for `__pypackages__` in the current working directory and its parent directories. That is, if you don't want to add a pdm run every time you execute a command, you can directly set the variable to the current environment, you only need to use the shell program in pdm --pep582 to enable pep582

Use the following command in `powershell` to add `pep582` to the system environment variables:

```powershell
pdm --pep582
```

Next configure the IDE to enable the IDE to support PDM:

#### VSCode settings
```bash
# Add the following two items to the top-level dictionary in .vscode/settings.json:
{
  "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"],
  "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"]
}
```

> Note: The `<major.minor>` above is the version number of python, such as `__pypackages__/3.10/lib` .

### 6. SSH configuration

##### 6.1 Check ssh

Run `powershell`, enter then command `ssh` to see whether the `ssh`command is installed:

![image.png](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/3e4dd10e-3021-4647-a9e4-09877140b6f6.png)

If the content is not as shown above, please install ssh command [Installing OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)

##### 6.2 Generate ssh public key locally

Enter the command `cd ~` to enter the current user directory, then enter the command `ls .ssh` to see whether the ssh key exists, i.e. `id_ed25519`,`id_ed25519.pub`, the following two files.

![查看ssh密钥.png](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/2997d374-f873-439b-ba77-d567adae155e.png)

If there is a path not found prompt as shown above, it means the file does not exist and it needs to to created. Enter the following command and execute it with a line feed.

```
ssh-keygen.exe -t ed25519
```

Ignore the prompt， and press the Enter key until the following prompt is completed. 

>  It is not recommended to use the default rsa encryption method to generate keys, rsa keys are disabled by default in higher versions of openssh

```vbscript
+---[ed25519 256]----+
|        .o       |
|        o        |
|      oo .       |
|.     ++o  .     |
|o.  ...*S.o      |
|.o+.o.o+=. .     |
|.o.+. o=.o+o     |
|. .. *oo.oB.o    |
| ...oE*.o=o+     |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Then, type `ls ~/.ssh` again, and the two files mentioned above will be displayed.

![密钥.jpg](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/38c66c66-6a58-4609-800a-032a13f0c3c8.JPEG)

Enter the command `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`, copy the output public key, log in to LEV, click `Create SSH Public Key` in `Account Settings`- `Public Key Management`, and copy the public key file content to submit.

#### 6.3 Configure the ssh config file

In the `C\user\(current username)\.ssh\` directory, create a `New Text Document.txt` and open it, paste the following content to the document and save:

```yaml
Host lev
    HostName service.lev.zone
    Port 2222
    User username # Note: please replace it with your username on the Leviathan
```

After saving, change the name of this file to `config`.

> Note: There is no txt suffix here, and it should be a file, not a text document.

Then enter the `ssh lev` command to verify that it is configured successfully.

```Bash
$ ssh lev
Connection to service.lev.zone closed. # indicate a successful configuration
```

If the following message appears, there is a problem with the configuration file, and please check the previous configuration steps.

```Bash
$ ssh lev
Permission denied (publickey). # It means the ssh public key is wrongly configured, and please check whether the ssh public key and username are correct
```

If the following error is reported:

```Bash
$ ssh lev
Bad owner or permissions on .ssh/config # It indicates that permission settings of the config file are not set correctly
```

Solutions:

1. Right click `config` - `properties` - `security` - `advanced` - `禁用继承` - `从此对象中删除所有已继承的权限` - `确定`
2. Right click `config` - `properties` - `security` - `edit` - `add` - `在输入对象名称来选择框中输入当前用户名` - `确定`
3. Then you can connect normally

If the above process shows an error, you can run the following command.

```bash
ssh username@service.lev.zone -p 2222
# （replace username with your username on the Leviathan, not the email account!）
```
